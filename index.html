            <p id="about_me"><a id="about_me"></a>Anthropologist turned machinist turned developer. From the beginning, I always liked to know how things worked. Whether it was my Dad's Mustang, my bike, or some random device I found in the garage, I always felt compelled to grab some tools and figure it out. As an adult, that curiosity extended to the way that humans interact with and perceive themselves. I lived and worked in Peru as an anthropologist before deciding on a new career. That decision led me to gunsmithing school in Colorado where I spent every day taking apart, diagnosing, repairing, and reassembling firearms brought in by customers, each with their own user stories and acceptance criteria. I bring the curiosity, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills developed in my manufacturing career to my work as a developer to ensure that your applications work as expected the first time, and every time.</p>
