Week 2 Homework

This is a first attempt at an online portfolio built from scratch using HTML and CSS.

It is meant to introduce the viewer to me as a developer. It includes an "About Me" section, a section which will link to future applications, and a section including contact information.

The website follows responsive design parameters that allow it to be viewed on both desktop machines as well as mobile/handheld devices.

Three links within the page header will direct the user to the three main sections, "About Me", "Portfolio", and "Contact.

The Portfolio section currently includes placeholder images that will serve as links to applications developed in the future. These currently open in a new tab and direct the user to Google. As applications are developed, their respective links will be applied and relevant screenshots selected as link images.

The Contact section currently provides a link to my email as well as my Github profile.
